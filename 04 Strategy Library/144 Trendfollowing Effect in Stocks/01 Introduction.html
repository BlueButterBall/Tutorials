Trend-following is one of the oldest trading techniques and trend-following systems belong to the standard repertoire of investors and traders. 
Many times, it has been successfully used in futures markets. Research shows it also works on stocks, and it performs well for such a simple strategy.
There are many trend-following systems with different rules, but all systems have a common attribute. 
They try to buy growing assets although "grow/trend" could be defined in many ways. 
We present a research paper documenting a simple trend-following system on stocks which uses all-time high as entry condition 
and <a href= "https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atr.asp">ATR(average true range)</a> as 
a <a href = "https://www.investopedia.com/video/play/how-use-trailing-stops/">trailing stop</a>. 
More specifically, the investor long the stocks if today’s close is greater than or equal to the highest close during the stock’s entire history, and places the trailing stop loss orders to exit.
