    The “52-week high effect” states that stocks with prices close to the 52-week highs have better subsequent returns than stocks with prices far from the 52-week highs. 
    Investors use the 52-week high as an “anchor” which they value stocks against. 
    When stock prices are near the 52-week high, investors are unwilling to bid the price all the way to the fundamental value. 
    As a result, investors under-react when stock prices approach the 52-week high, and this creates the 52-week high effect. 
    
    
    This tutorial strategy consists of 500 most liquid stocks which are assigned into 11 industry sectors. 
    We calculate each stock's ratio between its current price and 52-weeks high, and get the weighted ratios for each industry
    sector (the weights are stocks' market capitalizations). Then we pick the industry with highest(lowest) weighted ratio to long(short). The investment weights are equal within the industry sector, 
    and rebalance happens every month. There are two key points in this strategy: <br>
    1.To initialize a rolling window to track each stock's history prices so that we have access to its 52-weeks high;<br>
    2.To build a dictionary to store each stock's market capitalization as we will use it as weights when calculating weighted ratios for each industry.
